# Granular Synthesis 

June 5th, 2008, Mattijs Kneppers, modified by Joshua Batty 2015

# Real-time granular time stretcher / pitch shifter. 
Unlike spectrum-based (phase vocoder) time stretching approaches, granular time stretching has no inherent latency. This patch aims for the same sound quality (absence of artifacts) as the time stretching features of mainstream applications such as Ableton Live or Reaktor.

# Dependencies
This patch uses the pitch~ object by CNMAT, that you can download here:
http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads (scroll down to the alphabetical list of Individual Downloads and look for pitch~).

There have been reports of unexpected sound artifacts running this patch on PowerPC computers. I hope I addressed all of them, but if you run into problems please let me know, preferably with a recording of the artifacts you experienced.
